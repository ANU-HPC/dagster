Experiment Scripts:
-------------------

Basically a bunch of folders holding various scripts that kicked of experiments at some stages of dagster development.
Most of these are outdated and/or uninteresting, but kept around as a resource for the kinds of experiments, and the different ways that they can be initialised (monitored,experimented-with etc), and the various ways in which dagster can be experimented and evaluated.
