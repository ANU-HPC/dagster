Some older C files:

det7.c can be directly compiled and run, and it searches and output thoes matricies corresponding to graphs which have the largest determinant squared, it calculates the determinant square via gramm-schmitt process

det18.c finds the inverse of any matric via a gauss-jordan elimination technique, and then the correspondance (via matrix determinant lemma) that is a condition that the matrix is locally determinant maximal is reasoned about by passing the source file into CBMC bounded model checker.


These files are kept as truly alternative processes to reason about the determinant problem.
