Alphabet Benchmarks
-------------------


Collection of some experimental CNF generating scripts, specifically to encode a particular kind of problem.

ideally the idea extends from the possibility of redesigning the bitmap glyphs of english letters to make the most common words maximally distinct under different levels of simple binary blur.

experimental, and underdeveloped at the moment.
