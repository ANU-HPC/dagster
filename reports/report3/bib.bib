abstract = {Boolean Satisfiability is probably the most studied of combinatorial optimization/search problems. Significant effort has been devoted to trying to provide practical solutions to this problem for problem instances encountered in a range of applications in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), as well as in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study has culminated in the development of several SAT packages, both proprietary and in the public domain (e.g. GRASP, SATO) which find significant use in both research and industry. Most existing complete solvers are variants of the Davis-Putnam (DP) search algorithm. In this paper we describe the development of a new complete solver, Chaff, which achieves significant performance gains through careful engineering of all aspects of the search - especially a particularly efficient implementation of Boolean constraint propagation (BCP) and a novel low overhead decision strategy. Chaff has been able to obtain one to two orders of magnitude performance improvement on difficult SAT benchmarks in comparison with other solvers (DP or otherwise), including GRASP and SATO.},

abstract="Almost all CDCL SAT solvers use the 1-UIP clause learning scheme for learning new clauses from conflicts, and our current understanding of SAT solving provides good reasons for using that scheme. In particular, the 1-UIP scheme yields asserting clauses, and these asserting clauses have minimum LBD among all possible asserting clauses. As a result of these advantages, other clause learning schemes, like i-UIP and all-UIP, that were proposed in early work are not used in modern solvers. In this paper, we propose a new technique for exploiting the all-UIP clause learning scheme. Our technique is to employ all-UIP learning under the constraint that the learnt clause's LBD does not increase (over the minimum established by the 1-UIP clause). Our method can learn clauses that are significantly smaller than the 1-UIP clause while preserving the minimum LBD. Unlike previous clause minimization methods, our technique is not limited to learning a sub-clause of the 1-UIP clause. We show empirically that our method can improve the performance of state of the art solvers.",

abstract={We present a fast parallel SAT-solver on a message based MIMD machine. The input formula is dynamically divided into disjoint subformulas. Small subformulas are solved by a fast sequential SAT-solver running on every processor, which is based on the Davis-Putnam procedure with a special heuristic for variable selection. The algorithm uses optimized data structures to modify Boolean formulas. Additionally efficient workload balancing algorithms are used, to achieve a uniform distribution of workload among the processors. We consider the communication network topologiesd-dimensional processor grid and linear processor array. Tests with up to 256 processors have shown very good efficiency-values (>0.95).},

abstract = {We introduce a greedy local search procedure called GSAT for solving propositional satisfiability problems. Our experiments show that this procedure can be used to solve hard, randomly generated problems that are an order of magnitude larger than those that can be handled by more traditional approaches such as the Davis-Putnam procedure or resolution. We also show that GSAT can solve structured satisfiability problems quickly. In particular, we solve encodings of graph coloring problems, N-queens, and Boolean induction. General application strategies and limitations of the approach are also discussed.GSAT is best viewed as a model-finding procedure. Its good performance suggests that it may be advantageous to reformulate reasoning tasks that have traditionally been viewed as theorem-proving problems as model-finding tasks.},

In this correspondence, we report the results of applying local search techniques to solve the satisfiability problem. While a traditional resolution-based algorithm is not able to handle even moderately sized inference problems, a local search algorithm, tested through years of real program execution, is capable of computing very large-scale inference problems with fast, robust convergence. On a workstation computer, for example, it is able to solve a satisfiability problem with 50,000 clauses and 5,000 variables in a few seconds.},

abstract = {The satisfiability problem is known to be NP-Complete; therefore, there should be
relatively small problem instances that take a very long time to solve. However, most
of the smaller benchmarks that were once thought challenging, especially the satisfiable
ones, can be processed quickly by modern SAT-solvers. We describe and make available
a generator that produces both unsatisfiable and, more significantly, satisfiable
formulae that take longer to solve than any others known. At the two most recent international
SAT Competitions, the smallest unsolved benchmarks were created by this generator.
We analyze the results of all solvers in the most recent competition when applied
to these benchmarks and also present our own more focused experiments.},
